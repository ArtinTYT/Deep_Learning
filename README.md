# Li Mu's Dive into Deep Learning

## Project Overview

1. **Code**: This project contains code implementations from Dr. Mu Li's book "Dive into Deep Learning" (åŠ¨æ‰‹å­¦æ·±åº¦å­¦ä¹ ), with detailed comments for easier learning.
2. **Theory**: Theoretical notes are shared on my blog: [neurowave](https://neurowave.tech/). The theory is based on Dr. Mu Li's [video course](https://courses.d2l.ai/zh-v2/) and the [official book](https://zh.d2l.ai/chapter_preface/index.html).

> Note: The order of the video content may differ from the book, but both cover the essential knowledge points. The book provides complete theoretical derivations, while the videos focus on key techniques and applications.

**Resources:**
- **Official Book:** [Dive into Deep Learning](https://zh.d2l.ai/chapter_preface/index.html)
